ShopSmart Data Analysis Project
Sales Performance & Customer Insights

Analyst: Ifeoluwa Samuel Sunday
Role: Aspiring Data Analyst
Project Date: September 2025
Tools Used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib,seaborn)

About This Project
As a beginner data analyst, I worked on cleaning and analyzing ShopSmart's sales data to understand their business performance. This project helped me practice real-world data cleaning, analysis, and visualization skills using Python.

What I Did
Step 1: Understanding the Data
I started by exploring two datasets:

Customer information (names, locations)
Purchase records (products, prices, quantities)

I used basic Python commands to get familiar with the data:

head() - to see the first few rows
info() - to check data types and missing values
describe() - to see basic statistics

Step 2: Cleaning the Data

Removed duplicate entries
Merged the customer and purchase tables together
Created a new column called Total (price × quantity)
Fixed the date format to be consistent (DD-MM-YYYY)

Step 3: Analyzing the Data
I used groupby() to organize and summarize the data:

Found top customers by total spending
Calculated sales by product category
Analyzed sales by city
Identified best-selling products

Step 4: Creating Visualizations
I made charts to help visualize the patterns in the data, making it easier to understand and share with others.

What I Found
1. Monthly Sales Pattern
What I Noticed: January had high sales, but sales dropped significantly in the next month.
Why This Matters: Understanding these patterns helps the business plan better for slow months.
My Suggestion: ShopSmart could run special promotions in slower months to keep sales steady.

2. Electronics is the Winner
What I Noticed: Electronics had much higher sales than Furniture or Clothing.
The Numbers:

Electronics dominated overall sales
3 out of the top 5 customers bought Electronics
Electronics sales were higher than the average across all categories

My Suggestion:

Keep Electronics well-stocked since it's the main money-maker
Try promotions or discounts on Furniture to boost those sales


3. Popular Price Point
What I Noticed: Many orders were around £200, with multiple customers purchasing at this price.
Why This Matters: This tells us what customers are comfortable spending.
My Suggestion: Focus on products in this price range to match customer preferences.

4. Quantity and Sales Connection
What I Noticed: When customers buy more items, the total sales go up (as expected).
Why This Matters: This helps predict:

How much inventory to keep
When to reorder products
Future sales based on demand


5. Location Matters
What I Noticed: Different cities showed different buying patterns, especially between Electronics and Furniture.
My Suggestion: Customize marketing and inventory based on what each location prefers.

My Recommendations for ShopSmart

Focus on Electronics - It's your best seller, so keep it front and center
Help Furniture Sales Grow - Try discounts, bundle deals, or better advertising
Plan for Slow Months - Create strategies to avoid big drops after January
Take Care of Top Customers - Consider a loyalty program for your best spenders
Use Data for Inventory - Let the sales patterns guide how much stock to keep


What I Learned
Skills I Practiced:

Cleaning messy data (removing duplicates, fixing formats)
Merging multiple datasets
Using groupby and filtering to find patterns
Creating visualizations to tell a story with data

My Biggest Takeaway:
Visualization really changed how I understood the results! Seeing the data in charts made patterns obvious that I couldn't see in just tables and numbers.
Honest Reflection:
I don't have all the Python code memorized yet, but I now understand how the different parts work together. I learned that:

Cleaning data is crucial - bad data = bad insights
Grouping helps find patterns - it organizes messy information into clear categories
Charts communicate better - stakeholders can understand visuals faster than spreadsheets

Why Python Instead of Excel?
I learned that while Excel can do some of this work, Python is better when:

Datasets are really large (Excel has row limits)
You need to repeat the same analysis often
You want to automate your workflow


Reflection Questions
1. What new trend did you discover?
The January sales spike followed by a decline, and how strongly Electronics dominates every customer segment.
2. How did filtering and grouping help?
It sorted through all the transactions to show only the important patterns - like which customers spend the most or which products sell best.
3. How did visualization change your understanding?
Charts made everything click! I could instantly see which categories performed best and spot trends that were hidden in the raw numbers.
4. What would you do next as the analyst?
I would present these findings to the ShopSmart team with specific ideas to increase sales, especially for slower months and underperforming product categories.

Next Steps for My Growth
As I continue learning, I want to:

Practice more with Python until the code feels natural
Learn how to build interactive dashboards
Study customer segmentation techniques
Understand predictive modeling for forecasting

This project showed me that data analytics is about finding stories in numbers and helping businesses make better decisions!

Portfolio Note: This is a learning project completed as part of my journey to becoming a data analyst. I'm building practical skills in Python, data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. thank you xxxx
